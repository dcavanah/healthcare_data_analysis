#  **Data Analysis Problem **

*  Use the dataset healthcare data frame (see below) to fit  
     +  an OLSR linear (lm) model
     +  a CART (rpart) model
*  to predict **costs**

*  Explore the dataset as needed to guide your analysis  
*  Prepare your dataset (e.g., to avoid overfitting)  
*  Fit your models using lm and rpart  
*  Tune your models to optimize performance    
*  Show and *explain* your results, use plots where appropriate  
*  Evaluate model performance  
*  State your conclusions
